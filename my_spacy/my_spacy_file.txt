From zero to hero: Creating a chatbot with Rasa NLU and Rasa Core
AI assistants are a hot topic these days. Chances are that you have already had an encounter with at least one of them,
as a user or as a developer. In this post, I would like to talk about a stack of software called Rasa, which you should
definitely include in your toolbox if you would like to build conversational assistants yourself.

In short, Rasa NLU and Rasa Core are two open source Python libraries for development of conversational AI.
They are packed with Machine Learning and handle natural language understanding and dialogue management tasks.
Most importantly, Rasa stack is easy to use, you don’t need massive amounts of training data to get started and it is perfectly suited for production.


I have been building chatbots with Rasa stack for almost a year now and it is safe to say, that it has been a tool that
I have been the most excited about throughout that time. And here is why:

It is open source. You own your data and you can hack things.
 It is developer friendly. You don’t even need to know Python to use it.
 It has an awesome community and highly involved developers. If you have any issues,
 just post a message on Rasa Community Forum and someone from Rasa team or other developers will help you out.
 It is a great example of how applied research can be shipped to practice and empower thousands of developers around the world.
So… With all that in mind, I decided to make a tutorial on how to create a chatbot using
Rasa stack completely from scratch. It is going to be an exhaustive tutorial, with a deep dive into
Python (if you don’t code in Python, don’t get discouraged – check the Rasa documentation of how you can do it all
without any Python whatsoever). I am going to build a simple Slack integrated weather bot, called Frank.
I highly encourage you to follow along so grab a cup of tea and let’s build some chatbots!
